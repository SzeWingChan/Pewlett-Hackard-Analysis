# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the Pyber Analysis
- After importing data into the SQL database, queries could be performed to understand employees' profiles and forecast the number of retiring employees (employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955), their tiles and which department they belong.  

- The company will also be able to identify talents who will be eligible for a mentorship program and prepare them for taking up the roles when the employees reach the retirement age.


## Results

- Retiring Employees by Title 
    - It is estimated that 72,458 employees, who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955, will start reaching their retirement age.
    - Majority of them are senior engineers (35.8%) and senior staff (34.4%), followed by engineers (12.8%), staff (10.5%), technique leaders (5.0%), assistant engineers (1.5%) and managers (0.0%). 
    - There are only two managers that are expected to retire and the number is extremely small compare to other groups.
